      Someone on the Internet once endowed me with a profound insight:

        <caption>
          Pure Functional Programming is Unpractical

      </mediaobject>
    </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
    <title>Oh really?</title>
    <para>
      And I thought to myself:

  Then after much deliberation, psychoanalysis, hypothesising, a psychology degree and peer discussion, I arrive at the current, following position: ... Oh I see, you are just exhibiting your anxiety neurosis in an acute episode, while simultaneously attempting to hide it. Nothing to do with functional programming, right, I understand. Well carry on then. We'll be over here discussing functional programming.

  But this doesn't stop the emails coming in
    * I want to be a functional programmer, how?
    * Am I a functional programmer? (Yes/No/FileNotFound)
    * My peers are not interested in functional programming, but I am &mdash; how do I escape?
    * Is the SwiggleTwiz language a functional programming language?
    * How can I do functional programming in the real [imaginary, neurotic] world?
        * YOU ALREADY ARE! KTHXBAI

 These questions already assume (incorrectly) *way* too much about what functional programming even is.

 * Perhaps then, we should ask, what is functional programming?
    * But nobody likes being told that they don't know what functional programming is
    * The emails keep coming

 * Let's then, suggest more appropriate, answerable questions
    * Functional programming is a thesis
    * We measure adherence to the FP thesis along a *continuum* (slider)
    * To what extent am I functional programming?
      * Incidentally, I have never met a programmer for which the answer to this is zero, or even close to it.
    * To what extent does the SwizzleTwig language accommodate adherence to the functional programming thesis?
